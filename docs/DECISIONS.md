# Decisions and interview

Updated: 15 October 2026. Individual answers below are accepted directions. They do not imply approval of the entire specification.

## Accepted founder decisions

| ID | Decision | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D01 | Aim for a business capable of rapid growth. | Q1: “A business aimed at rapid growth.” |
| D02 | Explore consultants, marketing/brand-monitoring buyers and general readers; pivot from evidence. | Q2: “all of them and then we pivot based on what we get.” |
| D03 | Broad source access must precede customer testing. | Q3: “Only test after broad platform access is secured.” |
| D04 | Following public creators must not require those creators to join. | Q4: “Yes — creators should not need to join.” |
| D05 | Usable content first; comments and audience statistics later. | Q5: “Yes — usable content first; richer analysis later.” |
| D06 | Investigate scraping through Apify, Bright Data and other suppliers. | Subsequent instruction: “we will scrape with apify, brighdata and others”. |
| D07 | Execute source-access proof v0.1, all seven families, five public sources each, seven days, 150 generated-audio minutes and €50 total, free credits first. | Q6: “Yes — approve the proof, up to €50 total.” |
| D08 | Defer live checks of all scraping providers and assume they work for continued product planning. No provider authentication or spending now. | “ignore apify for now, assume that it works”; then “same for other scrapers”. |

Original requested product behavior: topics rather than a simple post list; snippets and original references; profile-based relevance; daily updated-source counts; historical timeline; preserve credit to creators. Sponsors, brands, sentiment, reach and comment sentiment are part of the vision, with D05 deferring the richer access requirement.

## Recommendations superseded by those decisions

- A small profitable business as the primary goal: superseded by D01.
- Independent AI consultants as the sole initial customer group: superseded by D02.
- A limited RSS/newsletter-only customer concierge test before broad access: rejected by D03.
- Requiring creator partnerships as the universal collection route: incompatible with D04.
- Treating official API availability as the only feasible access route: superseded by D06. Platform documentation remains useful evidence of constraints and risks.
- Completing supplier proof before continuing product specification: superseded by D08. Actual content access remains unverified; feasibility is assumed for planning. This does not turn the earlier feed preflight into an all-platform pass.

```

The founder has deferred scraper verification. Continue the daily-product branch using explicit assumptions. Do not ask for supplier login again or treat the deferred proof as a prerequisite to discussing/approving the product specification. Actual customer testing remains unstarted and unapproved.

## Q6 — approved

The founder approved docs/ACCESS-PROOF.md v0.1: all seven source families, five public sources each, seven days, at most 150 generated-audio minutes and a €50 total cash cap, using free credits first. Response: “Yes — approve the proof, up to €50 total.” This approves only the collection experiment, not SPEC.md or app implementation.

At that checkpoint execution required a signed-in provider account. D08 subsequently deferred this requirement and all scraper execution for now. No credentials were requested in chat or saved in the project.

## Approval register

Current product round, awaiting answers:

- Q7: first release as a phone-friendly website. Recommended yes; native apps later.
- Q8: onboarding through editable starter source collections and pasted creator links. Recommended yes; following-list import later.
- Q9: date-ordered history, with topics inside each day prioritized using explicitly chosen interests and an all-updates view. Recommended yes.

These are proposals, not approved requirements. The earlier provider-sign-in question is withdrawn under D08.

| Artifact | Version/status | Approval evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product specification | 0.1 — draft | None |
| Source proof brief | v0.1 approved in Q6; execution DEFERRED by D08 | Supplier capability assumed for planning; no current sign-in/spending action. |
| Customer pilot | Conditional proposal | None; waits for broad access |
| Implementation plan | Draft with blocked milestones | None for app implementation |

Do not infer agreement from silence or convert recommendations into accepted decisions. Record the version, date and founder's response when approval is given.
